        There have also been studies for a possible human mission to Mars,
        including a landing, but none have been attempted. Soviet Union's Mars
        3, which landed in 1971, was the first successful Mars landing. As of
        2023, the Soviet Union, United States and China have conducted Mars
        landings successfully.
